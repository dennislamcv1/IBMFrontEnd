## IBM Front-End Developer Professional Certificate (11 course series)

Front-end developer is one of the top 4 in-demand IT roles according to recruiters (Statista). This program gives you the job-ready front-end development skills to plan, build, deploy, and test web designs and applications employers are looking for in just 4 months. No prior experience required. 

Front-end developers turn design concepts into interactive experiences—coding what users see and ensuring websites and apps are visually engaging, responsive, and accessible.

This program takes you from the basics of web development to building dynamic, responsive applications. You'll learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React — mastering how to create user-friendly interfaces and interactive websites. Plus, you’ll explore UI/UX design, using tools like Figma and Bootstrap, and essential concepts like version control with Git and GitHub.

You'll build skills in software engineering principles, cloud-native development, and Agile practices. With hands-on projects — including a capstone where you'll design, build, and deploy a dynamic web application — you'll build a strong portfolio that showcases your expertise and gives you plenty to talk about in interviews. 

Plus, you’ll gain exclusive access to career resources to help you in your job search, including mock interviews and resume support.

If you’re looking to kickstart your career in front-end development with skills and hands-on experience employers need, enroll today!
